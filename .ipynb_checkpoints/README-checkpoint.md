## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis created two datasets holding eleven columns of the components and a column of quality of red and white wine in 2009.The instance of red wine is 1599 and white wine is 4898. There are no missing attribute values. Each column expresses fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol and quality. Quality is graded by wine experts within 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent). Some datas such as grape types, wine brand, the price of wine are not provided.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

As a wine lover, I would like to find which component has an impact on the quality negatively and positively and I am interested in knowing if there is any component affect the component that strongly relates to the quality. I also would like to find out if the tendency I would find in red wine affects white wine similarly and vice versa. By analysing these datasets, I would like to acquire the skill of using python to read and filter the datasets and the several points of view to find any tendency of the datasets and connect the possibilities to extend the tendency and facts that I found to new fields or business.
